This leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.\n<a href=\"https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-14145\">CVE-2020-14145</a> Title: CVE-2020-14145 </br> Score: 4.3 </br> Description: The client side in OpenSSH 5.7 through 8.4 has an Observable Discrepancy leading to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by the client).\n<a href=\"https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-15778\">CVE-2020-15778</a> Title: CVE-2020-15778 </br> Score: 6.8 </br> Description: scp in OpenSSH through 8.3p1 allows command injection in the scp.c toremote function, as demonstrated by backtick characters in the destination argument. NOTE: the vendor reportedly has stated that they intentionally omit validation of \"anomalous argument transfers\" because that could \"stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows.\""
